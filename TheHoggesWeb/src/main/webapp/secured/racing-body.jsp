Rick began roadracing motorcycles with the CMRA in 2000. Since then he has suffered several concussions, a broken leg and massive hemorrhaging
 of cash. He now focuses his attention to an endurance team called <A href="javascript:popup('http://www.desert-rats.net', 'DesertRats');">Desert Rats.</A>

Here is some history for those interested:
<BR>
<BR>
I started racing motorcycle in February of 2000 as an amateur in the <A href="javascript:popup('http://www.cmraracing.com','cmra');">Central Motorcycle Roadracing Association (CMRA)</A>.  We compete monthly in races in across Texas and Oklahoma.  I haved raced many different bikes including Hondas, Yamahas and Suzukis.  
I did quite well my novice year winning 5 championships and claiming 3 track records. My next year was up and down. I fulfilled a long time goal of competing in a AMA professional race. Jess and I traveled to Pikes Peak, Colorado and I ran in the 600 and 750 supersport classes. I did fantastic (18th) considering I was the only one who showed up with their bike in the back of a pickup truck.
<BR>
<P>Shortly after my return to Texas, I broke my fibula in a close race with a <A href="javascript:popup('<html:rewrite page="/imager/images/2001/2001-10-28 Up close and personal at 100mph/RickTy.JPG"/>','crash');">friend</A> at Texas World Speedway. I walked around on the leg for two months before I finally had it X-Rayed and determined it needed to be plated. Luckily this happened at the end of the season.</P>
<P><BR>Racing has now become a true hobby and we thoroughly enjoy our time with our friends at the track.
I hope to continure racing as long as my body allows and someday pass on this fascination to my future children.</P>
<P><BR>For those still looking for more here is my race <A href="javascript:popup('<html:rewrite page="/raceresume2000.htm"/>','resume','height=600,width=640,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,status=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,location=no');">resume</A> for the end of my 2000 race year.
